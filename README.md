# ConnectedDriveAPI

Work in progress reverse engineering of BMW Connected Drive APIs, focussed on the i3/i8 utilities but generic features should work for 
any vehicle. 

Currently will only work with EU/ECE vehicles, as the endpoint is hardcoded. The library also does not include the client secret used by BMW, and expects it to be provided.
